<h1>The Tundra</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/habitats/tundra">Tundra habitat is found in the Arctic, beyond the permanent ice pack that surrounds the North Pole. It is a habitat of contrasting seasons, with temperatures as low as –76 degree Fahrenheit (–60 degrees Celsius) in the winter and almost no sunlight, to temperatures as high as 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) in the short summer season.

    Even with the warm summer, however, the lower levels of soil remain frozen all year, and this is known as permafrost. A surprising variety of plants still manage to live here by growing and producing seeds quickly to take advantage of the summer sun and warmth, then dying back or hardening up against the winter cold. They tend to grow shallow roots over a wide area to avoid the permafrost, and they tend to grow low to the ground, even the few trees like the dwarf willow, to avoid the bitter and dehydrating tundra wind.

    Many animals found on the tundra are migratory species, moving in to eat the plants in the summer, but leaving again before the hard winter. Some remain all year, though, like the polar bear, the musk ox, and the snowy owl. The word tundra comes from the Finnish word "tunturi" meaning treeless plain. The tundra's cold, windy climate means trees cannot survive, but short plants can thrive in the warmer months.</blockquote>

<h1>The Polar Bear</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/polar-bear">Perhaps no other wildlife symbolizes the frozen tundra regions of the Earth as do polar bears. They live on ice and snow, but that’s not a problem—these bears have some cool ways to stay warm! An outer coat of long guard hairs that stick together when wet protects a dense, thick undercoat of fur. On land, water rolls right off of the guard hairs. Even though polar bears look white, their hair is really made of clear, hollow tubes filled with air. Scarring or residue on the fur can cause the “white” fur to appear to human eyes as cream colored, yellow, or even pink in the Arctic light.

    Fat acts as a nutritional reserve and energy storage when food can’t be found, and may provide the ability to generate heat to help insulate polar bears from the freezing air and cold water. This fat may also help the bears float in the water. It is 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) thick.

    Unlike brown bears and black bears, polar bears do not hibernate, and only pregnant females over-winter in dens. While in the den, the pregnant female’s activity level decreases and her metabolism slows down. During this period, she gives birth and nurses her cubs. Sometimes, when weather conditions are particularly rough, other bears may dig temporary shelters, where they spend several days at a time.

    The polar bear is the newest of the eight bear species, and scientists believe that the polar bear evolved about 200,000 years ago from brown bear ancestors. Both polar bears and brown bears are big and are the largest land carnivores. But most experts agree that polar bears are the longest bears, as males may measure over 10 feet (3 meters) when standing on their hind legs.

    Small bumps on the pads of a polar bear’s large, wide paws may add traction and help the bear walk on slippery ice. Polar bears spend their days hunting and sleeping after a good meal. For some, these meals need to last them during the upcoming months when the Arctic ice has melted, and they are forced to spend their days on land waiting for the fall cold to once again form the very important ice.

    When not hunting, polar bears are resting, perhaps as much as 20 hours a day. Polar bears are great bed makers, building nest-like beds in seaweed piled up on the coast, digging deep caves of snow into the bluffs, or resting in a shallow snow bed and letting the blowing snow cover them, making for a snug day den.</blockquote>
<h2>Their Diet and Habitat</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/polar-bear">Polar bears live throughout the Arctic, in areas where they can hunt seals in wide cracks in the sea ice or at breathing holes. The taxonomic name for polar bears is Ursus maritimus, which means sea bear, a fitting name for these champion swimmers. They have been known to swim more than 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) without rest in search of food, using their broad front feet for paddling and their back legs like rudders to steer. Unfortunately, due to loss of ice, the bears are now having to swim longer distances, as much as a few hundred miles, which takes a toll on their energy and fat storage.

    Despite the long, harsh winter, polar bears don’t hibernate. In fact, most of them (except pregnant females) continue to hunt seals throughout the winter. When the weather is extremely cold, and hunting is impossible, bears may seek temporary shelter in snow dens until conditions improve.

    A pregnant female stays in a snow den throughout her pregnancy, the birth of her cubs, and the first few months of the cubs’ life, without leaving the den. Changes in her metabolism allow her to go without food, water, defecation, or urination for as long as eight months. For most mammals, fasting during pregnancy would be life threatening, but the female bear gains a massive amount of weight before she dens. Her stored fat reserves provide all the energy she needs to sustain herself and her cubs. Still, she wakes easily. This process is called winter sleep.

    Polar bears have no natural enemies. Strong, ferocious, intelligent, and patient hunters, they top the food chain in the Arctic, where they dine primarily on seals. The bears can remain motionless for hours above a seal's breathing hole in the ice, just waiting for a seal to pop up. The polar bear's nose is so powerful it can smell a seal on the ice 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, sniff out a seal's den that has been covered with snow, and even find a seal's air hole in the ice up to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away. No wonder many people call them "noses with legs!"

    Polar bears can see well underwater, spotting potential meals 15 feet (4.6 meters) away. They have a nictitating membrane, or third eyelid, that allows them to see underwater and protects their eyes in blowing snow.

    Stiff fur on the sole of each foot keeps the bear from slipping on the ice. It also muffles the sound of the bear’s approach when sneaking up on a sleeping seal. It costs a polar bear twice as much energy as most other mammals to move about in its Arctic environment. This helps explain their preference for resting frequently and hunting for seals using ambush techniques rather than stalking their prey.

    The ringed seal is the polar bear’s main prey, as it is the most numerous seal in the Arctic. One ringed seal provides a polar bear with enough energy for 11 days. Polar bears typically kill and eat every four to five days. These bears eat just about anything, if they have the opportunity, but it is important to remember that they need access to the high-calorie diet that seals provide. While they will eat walrus, caribou, beached whales, grass, and seaweed, none of these have been shown to provide adequate and reliable nutrition for polar bears.

    Polar bears at the San Diego Zoo get a fortified meat-based commercial carnivore diet, dog kibble, trout and other fish, as well as root vegetables and lettuce as treats. Cow femur bones and thawed rabbits are added once or twice per week. Polar bears get very little nutrition or calories from vegetables, so these items are offered as treats, and the whole carrots keep their teeth clean.</blockquote>

<h1>Reindeer Caribou</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/reindeer-caribou">Reindeer or caribou? Even though no one has actually seen a reindeer fly, this special member of the deer family has a lot to live up to! Reindeer and caribou are classified as the same genus and species, Rangifer tarandus. In Europe, they are called reindeer. In North America, we typically use the name reindeer when we refer to Eurasian populations, and the name caribou to refer to most populations in North America. However, we use "reindeer" to refer to domesticated individuals, even those in North America.

    Antlers are the reindeer’s most memorable characteristic. In comparison to body size, reindeer have the largest and heaviest antlers of all living deer species. A male’s antlers can measure up to 51 inches (130 centimeters) long, and a female’s antlers can reach 20 inches (50 centimeters). Just as a tree has a trunk, so all antlers have a main beam and several branches or tines that grow from the frontal bones of the skull. Sometimes little branchlets or snags are also present. The tip of each antler is called a point. Unlike horns, antlers fall off and grow back larger every year. As new antlers grow, the reindeer is said to be in velvet, because skin, blood vessels, and soft fur cover the developing antlers. When the velvet dries up, the reindeer rubs it off against rocks or trees, revealing the hardened, bony core.

    Males begin to grow antlers in February and females in May. They both finish growing their antlers at the same time but shed their antlers at different times of the year. A male drops his in November, leaving him without antlers until the following spring, while female reindeer keep their antlers through the winter until their calves are born in May. This fact has led many to believe that, based on the presence of antlers, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer must have been a female to have those antlers on Christmas Eve!

    But what are the antlers for? They are handy weapons against predators, males use their impressive antlers (which can weigh up to 33 pounds or 15 kilograms!) to woo the females, and females use theirs to clear away the snow to find food.

    Reindeer are thought to have first been domesticated by Arctic peoples at least 3,000 years ago (and perhaps as long as 7,000 years ago) in northern Eurasia (Lapland) and still remain the only deer species to be widely domesticated. They are used as beasts of burden and farmed for milk, meat, and their hides.</blockquote>
<h2> Their habitat and Diet</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/reindeer-caribou">Reindeer are built for staying warm in freezing temperatures. They originally inhabited the tundra and forests of Scandinavia and northern Russia, and were then introduced into Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and Canada. They are covered in hair from their nose to the bottom of their feet!

    Reindeer come in a variety of colors, depending on the subspecies, the region, the sex, and even the season. They range from dark brown in woodland subspecies to nearly white in Greenland. A reindeer’s coat is usually a bit darker in summer and lighter in winter. Reindeer have two coat layers: an undercoat of fine, soft wool that stays right next to their skin, and a top layer of long, hollow guard hairs. The air trapped inside the guard hairs holds in body heat to keep a reindeer warm against wind and cold. The hollow hairs also help the reindeer float, allowing it to swim across a river, if needed.

    Having hairy hooves may look funny, but they give reindeer a good grip when walking on frozen ground, ice, mud, or snow. Spongy footpads help them walk in marshy fields, and in winter, their hooves harden so they can dig into the ice or snow and keep from slipping. Being broad, flat, and having two toes, a reindeer’s hooves also allow it to push water aside when it swims. The hooves are even used to scrape at snow while looking for food. A long dewclaw on each leg serves as an extra hoof to help a reindeer climb on rugged terrain.

    Another outstanding feature is right under the reindeer’s nose—actually, it IS its nose! The specialized nose helps to warm incoming cold air before it enters the lungs, and it also works as a super sniffer! Its sense of smell helps the reindeer find food hidden under snow, locate danger, and recognize direction. Reindeer mainly travel into the wind to pick up scents. Reindeer are the only deer to have hair completely covering their nose.

    Depending on where they live, reindeer have to watch out for golden eagles, gray wolves, brown bears, Arctic foxes, mountain lions, coyotes, lynx, and dholes. A healthy adult reindeer is usually safe from predators, especially in a large herd, where many individuals can watch for danger. It is the youngest reindeer calves that are most susceptible to predation. Old, weak, ill, and injured reindeer are also vulnerable. After the breeding season, many bulls are exhausted or injured, and they are also at risk.

    Reindeer are ruminants. When available, they eat mosses, herbs, ferns, grasses, and the shoots and leaves of shrubs and trees, especially willow and birch. In winter, they make do with lichen (also called reindeer moss) and fungi, scraping the snow away with their hooves to get it. A special enzyme in their stomach breaks down lichen, an energy-rich food. An average adult reindeer eats 9 to 18 pounds (4 to 8 kilograms) of vegetation a day.

    At the San Diego Zoo, the reindeer are fed alfalfa hay, acacia browse, and low-starch, high-fiber biscuits.</blockquote>
