     <p> The desert is a very hot and dry place. Although it seems as if not much life could be there, there is actually a lot of animals and such living there.
         There is a variety of animals ranging from birds to reptiles and mammals to insects.
         You may be asking how they are living in harsh conditions. These animals/insects have learned to adapt to these conditions. For example, we will be presenting you with 2 animals/reptiles.
     These animals are the Armadillo and a Desert Tortoise.</p>

<h1>A Desert Tortoise </h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/desert-tortoise">The Mojave Desert’s summers are harsh, making it difficult to be active, with temperatures reaching well above 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) and with very little (if any) rain. Yet the desert tortoise is well adapted to deal with such extreme weather by going into estivation (decreased physiological activity) in a burrow during the extreme heat of the summer.

    A tortoise’s front limbs work like shovels, with long, sturdy nails that are good for digging. Large, cone-shaped scales on the limbs provide protection from scratchy vegetation the tortoise may encounter and help it retain water. Cleverly, the tortoise digs basins in the soil to catch the infrequent rain that falls. The tortoise remembers where these “watering holes” are and walks directly to them after a bit of rain. Another water-saving tactic is storing up to 40 percent of its body weight in water inside the bladder, to be absorbed as necessary.

    Desert tortoises live in underground burrows. By spending so much time underground, they are able to survive on very little food. These cold-blooded critters are the same temperature as their surroundings, so their burrow allows them to keep cool in the hot temperatures. During the winter, when food is scarce, tortoises brumate, a form of reptilian hibernation, in their burrow with a wall of dirt at the entrance to keep out the rain and cold for the entire winter season. Come spring, tortoises emerge and bask in the warm sun to jump-start their metabolism. They then devour vegetation with great relish!

    Burrows also protect the tortoises from predators. Coyotes and kit foxes prey on adult tortoises. Badgers, skunks, ground squirrels, ravens, Gila monsters, and roadrunners can prey on juvenile tortoises and tortoise eggs. Interestingly, other wildlife such as pack rats, burrowing owls, kangaroo rats, desert jackrabbits, gopher snakes, banded geckos, and cactus wrens also use tortoise burrows. From ground level, they extend down about 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 meters), typically at a 45-degree angle. Normally one burrow houses a single individual, or one male and one female.

    Desert tortoises may also create a den or cave, dug horizontally into the banks of dry washes and extending 8 to 30 feet (2.4 to 9 meters). Several tortoises can occupy one den at the same time, especially during brumation. One record showed 17 tortoises using the same winter den!

    Rainfall and temperature control the tortoises’ movements; desert tortoises are most active in spring, early summer, and fall before the colder weather sets in. During the active season, they move across their home range to forage, using multiple burrows as needed. After foraging, tortoises may plop down in a limp, spread-eagle posture with limbs and neck extended, possibly to increase body temperature and help digestion.

    Desert tortoises are herbivores, dining on grasses, flowers, fruit, and cactus. These foods contain a lot of moisture, and desert tortoises can go for up to one year without access to fresh water! Tortoises do not have teeth; instead, they have a beak and grind their food. Examples of preferred tortoise forage are prickly pear cactus, primrose, beavertail cactus, white clover, hibiscus, globemallow, desert dandelion, and desert marigold. Desert tortoises need about 20 to 30 days to digest their food, spreading the seeds from their meals across their habitat as they poop. This aids in the repopulation of native plants and grasses in the Mojave Desert.</blockquote>
<h1>Armadillo</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/armadillo">ABOUT
    A mammal with a shell? The armadillo is really strange looking. Although most armadillos look like they are bald, they do have wiry hairs on the sides and the belly. Some people refer to the hairs as curb feelers, since armadillos can feel their way around an area at night as the hairs touch objects.

    The one thing that tells everyone they are looking at an armadillo is the roly-poly shell with "armored" bands. The number of bands depends on the species. These hardened, overlapping sections give most armadillos a pleated look.

    Although the bands are tough like fingernails, the shell is flexible, with softer skin that expands and contracts between the bands. Armadillos also have long claws for digging and foraging for food. Their peg-shaped teeth crunch on insects, an armadillo's favorite food.

    Looks can be deceiving. In the looks department, the nine-banded armadillo appears naked, while the pink fairy armadillo is mostly furry and has little shell. In fact, it looks like a mole wearing a fancy, armored headpiece and cape! In the size department, armadillos range in length from the pink fairy armadillo at 3 inches (8 centimeters) to the giant armadillo, which can be up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) long from head to tail and weigh up to 132 pounds (60 kilograms).

    Band on the run. There are 20 armadillo species in the Americas; most live in Central or South America. Only the nine-banded armadillo is native to the United States. As body size and food sources vary, so do the home range and habitat of each armadillo species. In fact, everything varies when you're talking about armadillos!

    Most armadillos like wetlands with thick shade and sandy soil that is easy to dig in. But they are also found in thorn scrub, grasslands, and wooded areas. Armadillos burrow in grass, hollow logs, and sometimes underground.

    The heat is on. The majority of armadillos are solitary most of the time. They travel to look for food and try to avoid danger. When the weather is cold, armadillos may group together in burrows, often making a large nest of leaves, with grass inside. They are not good at staying warm on their own and don’t seem to mind having others around. Seven-banded armadillos sometimes share the burrow with several others of the same gender.

    Armadillos have little body fat and thin shells, so they cannot maintain their internal temperature as most mammals do. This causes their behavior to change from season to season. For example, in hotter months, armadillos may be nocturnal, foraging at night when it is cooler and easy to move around. When the weather gets cooler, the same armadillos may start foraging earlier in the day, becoming more diurnal.

    Shell game. An armadillo's hard shell is simply modified skin that serves as one way they protect themselves. When an armadillo feels threatened, it usually runs, digs, or presses its body down in the dirt to keep from getting flipped over. The three-banded armadillo is the only type of armadillo that can roll up into a ball for protection: its teardrop-shaped head plate seals the opening so there are no chinks in the armor. Threats to armadillos include domestic dogs, wild cats, birds of prey, and humans.

    All my exes live in Texas. Nine-banded armadillos are also known as long-nosed armadillos because of their longer head and snout. Despite the common name, they can have eight or nine bands, depending on where they live. This is the type commonly seen in Texas, where it was adopted as the official state mammal.

    Armored king. Besides being the largest of the armadillos, the giant armadillo also has the most teeth, up to 100! It often rises on its back legs, balancing with its tail. It digs a burrow out of large ant nests, which are common in the Chaco region, using its six-inch claws. Little else is known about this amazing creature, one of the most endangered mammals in South America.

    HABITAT AND DIET
    All in the family. Armadillos are insectivores, and their closest relatives are sloths and anteaters. Although most of their diet consists of insects and invertebrates, armadillos also eat fruit, eggs, and small animals. They even eat carrion.

    When the weather is cold, armadillos may group together in burrows, often making a large nest of leaves, with grass inside. They are not good at staying warm on their own and don’t seem to mind having others around.

    Smell that? A sensitive nose helps armadillos sniff out tasty treats. Nine-banded armadillos grunt constantly while rooting around for food. If the food is underground, they use their long front claws to dig it up. This digging is why many people consider armadillos pests. Farmers and gardeners do not want armadillos rooting around for bugs while destroying their crops or plants.

    At the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park, armadillos eat a special insectivore pellet diet that is served dry or with water to make a paste, mealworms, crickets, and fruit or cooked root vegetables.</blockquote>
