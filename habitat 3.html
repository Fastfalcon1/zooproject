<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/habitats/rivers-lakes">Rivers are flowing water habitats, which can vary from an icy mountain stream to a huge tropical river. Lakes are still-water habitats, ranging from tiny rain pools to giant lakes many thousands of feet (meters) deep. Each of these habitats has its own wildlife, depending on factors such as how fast the water moves and is replaced, the nature of the rocks and soil, and the chemical makeup of the water itself.

    Rivers and lakes are usually freshwater habitats that support many forms of life, from algae and plankton to insects and fish to larger wildlife. The food chain and the interdependence of the wildlife in these habitats can be disrupted by pollution, pesticides, and erosion.</blockquote>

<h1>The Axolotl</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/axolotl">ABOUT
    Shrouded in mystery, and defying typical biological laws like metamorphosis, the axolotl (pronounced AX-oh-lot-ul), a type of salamander, keeps its webbed feet firmly placed in infancy throughout its life.

    Unlike other salamanders, axolotls are neotenic, meaning they keep juvenile characteristics into adulthood. The axolotl remains aquatic (like larvae) their entire life. Though it develops functional lungs, it uses its fancy, feathery gills to breathe underwater. Like youngsters, they retain external gills, a tail, and a body fin, and lack moveable eyelids.

    Naturally occurring  in Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco in the southern Mexico City neighborhood of Xochimilco, these fascinating creatures are rarely seen in person.

    Descended from the tiger salamander, the axolotl is “young", having inhabited central Mexico for only about the last 10,000 years, according to some experts. Indigenous to these two spring-fed lakes along the southern edge of the Basin of Mexico, much of its suitable habitat has been drained. The Xochimilco-Chalco basin, once about 77 square miles (200 square kilometers) of marshes, swamps, and lagoons, was significantly reduced 85 years ago when drainage projects were completed.

    The axolotl is charismatic and steeped in Mexican history, culture, and identity. That said, little information exists  about the ecology of axolotl populations. This situation is surprising, given the popularity of the axolotl for scientific study. However, their small and generally inaccessible populations make it difficult to obtain information about their behavior.

    What is known about axolotls has been obtained from laboratory colonies. Axolotls are dark-colored and can shift their hue a few shades lighter or darker as needed for camouflage! Pink and light-colored axolotls are bred by humans as pets for their “pleasing” shades.

    They are also used in laboratories to study another superpower: regenerating their limbs, lungs, heart, jaws, spines, and even parts of their brain! Scientists have found that axolotls can regrow a new limb five times perfectly, in a few weeks—without even a scar. Every tissue is replaced: skin, bone, cartilage, muscle, and stem cells. Other organs can regenerate countless times and be completely functional. Naturally, scientists would like to harness that ability and apply it to human medicine.

    It is said that this axolotls are over 1,000 times more resistant to cancer than mammals—another superpower worth investigating.  An axolotl can reach 18 inches in length, but nowadays grows to about 9 inches. Axolotls are dark-colored with greenish mottling; some may have silvery highlights on the skin. It has a broad, flat body with a large head donning its signature feathery gills waving gently in the water. Its mouth is often bent into a slight grin or is otherwise expressive. Round, dark eyes with yellow, iridescent irises take in its murky environment. It has lizard-like limbs that carry it along the lake bottom. It weighs about as much as a can of soup. In a pinch, the axolotl can move an astonishing 10 miles per hour (15 kilometers per hour).
    <h2>Their Diet and Habitat</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/axolotl">The axolotl is lentic, meaning it inhabits still-water lakes. They occur in only two: Mexico’s Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco, where they are Critically Endangered due to pollution, habitat degradation, and water diversion from an ever-growing human population.

        Conservationists are trying to help the axolotl by building “shelters” in Xochimilico, with stacks of rocks and reedy plants to help filter clean water that is pumped in. It is hoped that these amazing creatures will breed and thrive. Despite their infantile charm and undeveloped teeth, axolotls are effective predators, inhaling worms, mollusks, crustaceans, insect larvae, and even small fish! During the day, they burrow into the aquatic vegetation and mud to avoid being eaten, and at night they become animated…and hungry. While they use their gills to breathe underwater, they may pop up to the surface for a quick gulp of air from time to time.
        Feeding them in human care is another matter. Do the axolotls benefit from a varied diet or eating the same thing day after day? One recent study compared three different diets: bloodworm (invariant); Daphnia (a small aquatic crustacean) (invariant); and a mixture of these two prey items. The juvenile axolotls grew fastest on the bloodworm diet and slowest on the Daphnia diet, with a mixed diet resulting in intermediate growth rates. Thus, a mixed diet, as humans might prefer, may not be beneficial to the growth or welfare of axolotls as compared with a proper, high-quality, invariant diet.

        Using a suction technique, the axolotl consumes worms, tadpoles, insects, and small fish. Gravel may also get inhaled, which helps grind up food in its belly (just as birds use grit to break down food for digestion).The axolotl has few predators in the wilderness, though they may be taken by storks and herons, as well as large fish (carp and tilapia), on occasion. Their biggest threat is urbanization and pollution of the freshwater lakes and ponds they inhabit. Predation from introduced fish and large birds, as well as over-collecting them for food and medicine also contributes to their persistent decline.</blockquote>

<h1>Capybara</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/capybara">Is it a beaver without a tail? A hairy pig without a snout? No, it’s a capybara, the largest rodent in the world! Standing 2 feet (60 centimeters) tall at the shoulder and built somewhat like a barrel with legs, the “capy” has long, light brown, shaggy hair, a face that looks like a beaver’s, no tail, and slightly webbed feet. Originally thought to be a pig of some sort, we now know that the capybara is a rodent, closely related to cavies and guinea pigs.

    Africa has hippos, and the Americas have capybaras! Capys are found east of the Andes on Central and South American riverbanks, beside ponds, and in marshes or wherever standing water is available. Due to its dry skin, a capy requires a swimming hole as part of its lifestyle to stay healthy. Water is a source of life for the capybara, as they eat water plants and grasses and use the water itself to escape from danger. In fact, a capybara can stay underwater for up to five minutes at a time to hide from predators. It uses those webbed feet (four toes on each front foot and three on each back one) to swim as well as walk.

    The capybara has something in common with the hippo: its eyes, ears, and nostrils are all found near the top of the its head. A capybara can lift just those parts out of the water to learn everything it needs to know about its surroundings while the rest of its body remains hidden underwater.

    Capybaras also wallow in shallow water and mud to keep cool during a hot day before wandering out in the evening to graze. They tend to eat around dawn and dusk, but if capybaras feel threatened, they wait until the safe cover of night to eat.</blockquote>
<h2> Their habitat and Diet</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/capybara">Capybara live in Central and South America. They roam the swampy, grassy regions bordering rivers, ponds, streams. and lakes. Because capybaras are rodents, they share some common features with mice, squirrels, and porcupines. The most well-known of those features are probably those ever-growing front teeth. Capybaras use their long, sharp teeth for grazing on grass and water plants. An adult capy can eat 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kilograms) of grass per day! During the dry season, when fresh grasses and water plants dry up, capybaras eat reeds, grains, melons, and squashes. They also eat their own poop to get beneficial bacteria to help their stomach break down the thick fiber in their meals.

    Even though rodents aren’t closely related to ruminants like goats, cows, and giraffes, capybaras regurgitate their food to chew it some more. They chew their food from side to side, like a camel, rather than up and down, like we do. This is a good way to eat tough plant materials.

    At the San Diego Zoo, the capys are offered low-starch, high-fiber biscuits, assorted veggies and greens, and Bermuda grass hay.</blockquote>
