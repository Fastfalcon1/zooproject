<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/habitats/island">What all island ecosystems have in common is that they are isolated from the mainland, and they create special, even unique, environments with species of animals and plants that may be very different from their counterparts on the mainland. In fact, some species are only found on islands because they developed separately, like the kiwi of New Zealand and the Galàpagos tortoise of the Galàpagos Islands. Because they are limited in size and resources, island ecosystems are fragile and easily disturbed by introduced species and human activity. Island animals can quickly become endangered if their habitat is destroyed or what they eat disappears, because they have nowhere else to go.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/lemur">Lemurs are a type of prosimian, which means they are primates that evolved before monkeys and apes. They are more primitive than their cousins but share certain characteristics. Found in only one area on Earth—Madagascar and the nearby Comoro Islands—lemurs are considered the world’s most endangered group of mammals.

    Today there are over 100 lemur species. Their lemur-like primate ancestor is thought to have rafted over to Madagascar from Africa about 60 million years ago. With no competition from other primates and little predation, the original lemurs evolved to fill a large number of varying niches on the island.

    If you did not know what a lemur was, you might guess that it was related to a cat, squirrel, mouse, or dog. Lemurs are generally small in size, and their face somewhat resembles a mouse’s face in smaller species or a fox’s face in larger species. Many lemur species have a snout, and all have a wet and hairless nose with curved nostrils, which is unique among primates and makes them superior sniffers. They have five digits on front and hind limbs, and some species have longer hind limbs than forelimbs for jumping.

    Their tail is not prehensile and varies in length, depending on the species. Lemurs range greatly in size from the mouse lemurs to the indri. Lemurs have bright round eyes and soft fur that varies in color, depending on the species. The most common lemur colors are white, gray, black, brown, and red-brown. In some species, males and females have different coloring. For example, in blue-eyed black lemurs, males are solid black and females are reddish-brown.

    Lemurs that are diurnal (active during the daytime) ,are social and live in family groups or troops. They follow the safety-in-numbers idea, using alarm calls when a predator is spotted to inform the rest of the group. Nocturnal lemurs do not live in large groups, but have the cover of night to help protect them. And, some lemurs are active day and night. The primary predator of lemurs is the fossa, although they can fall prey to large boas, hawks, and introduced species, as well.


<h2>Their habitat and diet.</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/lemur">The habitat of lemurs and the terrain they live on varies greatly. Madagascar has a high mountain range running down its center, which has created several different climate areas. The east is wet, the west dry, and the south even drier. The plant life in these areas grew based on the rainfall, and lemurs evolved to fill the various niches, from rainforests to semi-deserts.

    The Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis is even more specialized than others. It has adapted to live its life in the marshland habitat surrounding a lake in the eastern region of Madagascar. It spends its days moving through the area on reeds and papyrus stalks as well as feeding on them.

    Most lemurs spend their time up in the trees, resting, sleeping, feeding, and even giving birth. The ring-tailed lemur, however, spends a good portion of its day on the ground. Lemurs tend to move on all fours, and their hands and feet are adapted for life in the trees. The pads on their hands and feet help lemurs stick when they jump onto something. Depending on their size, lemurs may make their home or sleeping spot in the fork of a tree, a tree hole, or a leaf nest.

    The diet of lemurs varies among species. Often the smaller lemur species feed primarily on fruit, insects, or sap, while larger species are mostly herbivorous, chowing down on plant material such as fruits, leaves, flowers, nectar, shoots, and bark</blockquote>
<h1>The Quokka</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/quokka">Aside from being named one of the best Scrabble words you’ll ever play, the quokka has a lot going for it, even as the smallest type of wallaby in Australia. About the size of a house cat, this fuzzy, pouch-packing, nocturnal herbivore is terrestrial, but can climb about 5 feet (1.5 meters) up a tree for a tasty snack. The quokka has a bounding gait interspersed with hopping; it does not use its tail as a tripod like kangaroos sometimes do.


    The quokka’s friendly, curious personality (even toward humans) is surpassed only by its perpetual “smile.” Of course, the quokka’s grin is largely due to its facial muscles and protruding front teeth, not the person on the ground waving around a selfie stick, trying to get a #quokkaselfie, which is trending in Australia (and worth an Internet search). While getting that close to wildlife is usually frowned upon—Instagram even created a warning for the quokka selfie hashtag stating that some images “may be associated with animal abuse”—it appears that the quokka on Rottnest Island are not showing any signs of distress posing for their closeup and are free to move away from the tourists when they choose.The quokka was common in coastal parts of the mainland of southwestern Australia until the 1930s, when the red fox Vulpes vulpes was introduced. This voracious hunter made short order of the quokka in many areas. Luckily, the foxes did not make it to Rottnest Island, so quokkas are more plentiful there. But across their range, human activities have negatively impacted their habitat—clearing for agriculture and housing, as well as recreational activity, fire regimes, and introduced animals all fragment suitable habitat for this (and other) native species.

    Yesterday and today.  The quokka was common in coastal parts of the mainland of southwestern Australia until the 1930s, when the red fox Vulpes vulpes was introduced. This voracious hunter made short order of the quokka in many areas. Luckily, the foxes did not make it to Rottnest Island, so quokkas are more plentiful there. But across their range, human activities have negatively impacted their habitat—clearing for agriculture and housing, as well as recreational activity, fire regimes, and introduced animals all fragment suitable habitat for this (and other) native species.

    Mainland quokkas occur in three main areas: the northern jarrah Eucalyptus marginata forest (north of Perth to Collie); fragmented reserves around Albany on the south coast; and the southern forest between Nannup and Denmark. They are more numerous on Rottnest Island, near Perth, and Bald Island, near Albany, largely due to lack of (or manageable) introduced predators.

    Interesting history of Rottnest Island: Mistaking this pint-sized marsupial for an oversized rat, in 1696, Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh named the island “Rattennest,” meaning “Rat’s Nest” in his mother tongue. It was later modified to Rottnest Island, where the quokka continues to thrive. These days, the island getaway is affectionately known as Rotto by locals.

    Hop to it.  Quokkas have coarse, brown fur that becomes lighter on the belly. Its rounded back, erect ears, small front hands and long rear feet, thinly-furred tail, and wet, black nose are not only great adaptations, but also give it high marks on the Absolutely Adorable test. Lacking a formidable bite, kick, or stench, the quokka instead quickly bolts down trodden paths through thick grasses to avoid predators. In a mad dash, it hops on its hind legs.</blockquote>
    <h2>Their habitat and Diet</h2>
    In short, quokkas inhabit shrubland, wetlands (inland), and forest. On islands, quokkas use a variety of habitats with sufficient cover, while mainland quokkas use dense vegetation in swamps amidst dry sclerophyll forest. The lynchpin of quokka habitat is cool, shady shelter to hole up in by day. They return to the same shelter each day, but may change it up in May or June. At night they emerge to feed on plant matter. Its frequently used paths serve as runways to escape predators.  Most quokkas take shelter in a thicket or some other shady, cool protected area during the day. They return to the same shelter at the end of each nighttime foraging expedition. On hot summer days, adult males may fight intensely for possession of the best, shady shelter sites. Availability of such shelters, rather than food, may be a limiting factor in quokka populations.
    A recent two-year spatial ecology study in the southern forests of Western Australia found that quokkas in the region had much larger home ranges and moved longer distances—up to 6.2 miles (10 km) per night!—than quokka in other areas. Twenty-nine quokkas (10 adult males, 16 adult females, and 3 subadult males) were fitted with VHF radio transmitter collars, providing hourly locations four times per month. Home ranges among female quokkas overlapped significantly, while males’ didn’t overlap with each other, but did overlap with multiple females. However, two males that emigrated away from the group during breeding season had core areas that significantly overlapped with other males, so their movement could have been in response to lack of mates or competitive behavior from other males. Or they just needed a change of scenery.

    It is perhaps no surprise that the largest quokka population is on Rottnest Island, a popular, car-free oasis 11 miles off the mainland coast, with miles of sandy beaches and forests, and no predators. Here, quokka appear to shed their nocturnal lifestyle and readily mix and mingle with visitors. The home range of quokkas also changes with the seasons. According to Walker’s Marsupials of the World, the wet season on Rottnest Island sees a home range used by quokkas covering 2.5 to 30.8 acres (10,000 to 125,000 square meters). During the dry season (November to April), the quokkas' feeding range increases to 5 to 42 acres (20,000 to 170,000 square meters). Some animals even move up in elevation to 5,900 feet (1,800 meters) to take advantage of soaks or fresh water seepages during the summer months, as there is little standing water available on Rottnest.
    Quokkas are herbivores, browsing on grasses and leaves. Preferring new growth, they show a preference for areas associated with fires, and the resulting fresh, succulent plant growth. According to the Australian Museum, quokkas on Rottnest Island subsist primarily on succulents and, to a lesser extent, the leaves of Acacia trees, called the wattles in Australia.

    Its ruminant-like digestive system resembles that of sheep: most of the 15 or so morphological types of bacteria present in the large stomach region of the quokka are similar to those in the rumen of sheep. Like all good ruminants, the quokka chews a cud.
